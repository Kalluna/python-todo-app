# python-todo-app
A simple command-line Todo List application built with Python. This project allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, storing them in a text file (todo_file.txt). It was created as a basic practice project to strengthen my Python skills and improve my understanding of file handling and user interaction via the terminal.
